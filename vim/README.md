# Personal VIM configuration
Configuration for Vundle which is my default plugin manager, Ctrl P, NERDTree and couple more smaller
plugins. Folder contains following files:

* _vimrc_home_example is example of _vimrc I put to my home folder
* base.vim contains Vundle just really core settings
* configuration folder contains config files splitted into configuration groups
* _vimrc is a merge of base.vim and all files inside configuration directory
